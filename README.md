## Wayne Fix Fork

This is a personal fork of
[`owen282000/life-dashboard-companion-app`](https://github.com/owen282000/life-dashboard-companion-app).
All original credit and the MIT license remain with the upstream project.

This fork adds a focused Health Connect fix for stale or missing Steps/Distance
exports on transferred devices or partial permission states. See
[`FORK_NOTICE.md`](FORK_NOTICE.md) for the exact changes and installation caveat.

Download Wayne's fixed build:
[`life-dashboard-companion-1.2.2-wayne.1-release.zip`](downloads/life-dashboard-companion-1.2.2-wayne.1-release.zip)

The ZIP contains the signed APK, release notes, attribution notice, and patch
file for this fork.

A privacy-focused Android app that syncs your **Health Connect** and **Screen Time** data to your own server via webhooks. Perfect for self-hosted dashboards, Home Assistant integrations, or any quantified self setup.

## Why This App?

- **Own Your Data** - Send health data to your own server, not third-party clouds
- **Flexible Webhooks** - Works with any backend that accepts JSON POST requests
- **Combined App** - Health Connect + Screen Time in one app
- **23 Health Data Types** - Supports all major Health Connect data types
- **Modern UI** - Built with Jetpack Compose and Material 3

## Features

### Health Connect Integration
- Syncs data from Google Health Connect to your webhook
- **23 supported data types:**
  - Activity: Steps, Distance, Active Calories, Total Calories, Exercise Sessions
  - Body: Weight, Height, Body Temperature
  - Body Composition: Body Fat %, Lean Body Mass, Bone Mass, Body Water Mass
  - Vitals: Heart Rate, Resting Heart Rate, Heart Rate Variability (HRV), Blood Pressure, Blood Glucose, Oxygen Saturation, Respiratory Rate
  - Sleep: Sleep sessions with stages
  - Nutrition: Hydration, Nutrition records
  - Mindfulness: Meditation sessions (from apps like Waking Up, Headspace)
- Per-data-type toggle and permission management
- Configurable sync interval (minimum 15 minutes)

### Screen Time Tracking
- Tracks app usage statistics via Android's UsageStatsManager
- **Configurable day boundary** - Perfect for night owls! If you set the boundary to 4 AM, any phone usage between midnight and 4 AM counts towards the previous day's total. This gives you accurate "real day" statistics instead of arbitrary midnight cutoffs.
- Syncs last 7 days of usage data
- App names resolved from package names

### Webhook Configuration
- **Multiple webhook URLs** - Send to multiple endpoints simultaneously
- **Custom headers** - Add auth tokens, API keys, or any custom HTTP headers per category
- **Separate configuration** - Different URLs and headers for Health and Screen Time

### Data Tools
- **Data preview** - View the exact JSON payload before syncing
- **Export as CSV/JSON** - Export sync logs via the Android share sheet
- **Sync history dashboard** - Overview of success rates, record counts, and recent failures

### General
- **Background sync** - Uses WorkManager for reliable background execution
- **Webhook logs** - View recent sync attempts with payloads for debugging
- **Health Connect install check** - Clear guidance when Health Connect is missing or outdated
- **Modern UI** - Material 3 design with dark mode support

## Requirements

- Android 14+ (API 34)
- [Health Connect](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.healthdata) app installed
- Usage access permission (for Screen Time feature)

## Installation

### Wayne Fix Build
1. Download
   [`life-dashboard-companion-1.2.2-wayne.1-release.zip`](downloads/life-dashboard-companion-1.2.2-wayne.1-release.zip).
2. Extract the ZIP and install the APK on your Android device.
3. Save your webhook URL and custom headers before uninstalling the upstream
   app. This build uses the same package name but a different signing key, so
   Android will not install it over the upstream GitHub release.
4. Reopen the app and grant Health Connect permissions fresh, including Steps
   and Distance.

### Upstream Releases
For the original unmodified app, download the latest APK from
[upstream releases](https://github.com/owen282000/life-dashboard-companion-app/releases/latest).

### Build from Source
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/owen282000/life-dashboard-companion-app.git
cd life-dashboard-companion-app

# Build debug APK
./gradlew assembleDebug

# The APK will be at: app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk

# Or install directly on connected device
./gradlew installDebug
```

## Setup

1. **Install the app** on your Android device
2. **Grant Health Connect permissions** - Tap "Grant" and select the data types you want to sync
3. **Grant Usage Access** (for Screen Time) - Go to Settings when prompted
4. **Configure webhook URLs** - Enter your server endpoint(s)
5. **Add webhook headers** (optional) - Configure auth tokens or API keys
6. **Set sync intervals** - Minimum 15 minutes
7. **Tap "Preview Data"** to inspect the payload, then **"Sync Now"** to send

const express = require('express');
const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

app.post('/api/health-connect', (req, res) => {
  console.log('Health data received:', req.body);
  // Store in database, forward to InfluxDB, etc.
  res.status(200).send('OK');
});

app.post('/api/screen-time', (req, res) => {
  console.log('Screen time data received:', req.body);
  res.status(200).send('OK');
});

app.listen(3000);
```
